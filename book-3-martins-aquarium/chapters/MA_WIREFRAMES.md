# Planning Before Coding: Wireframes

Planning before you code leads to success.

Coding before you plan leads to failure.

## Wireframes

A low fidelity wireframe is where you will start any new project. It is crucial that you understand the following.

1. What are the main visual components the user will see.
2. What is the layout and positioning for the visual components.
3. What content will be in each visual component.
4. If a visual component is interactive (i.e. can be clicked on) what will happen when it is clicked.

All of this information will impact how you develop your application. Therefore, it must be decided before you start coding, because it _guides_ how you will code.

## Examples

Ok, enough talk, time to see what a wireframe looks like.

### Low Fidelity Wireframe

Here is one that was developed by one of your predecessors for her capstone project. Note how the elements are just boxes or text. Nothing extra included, like colors, styling, or animations to confuse you.

### Low Fidelity Interaction Wireframe

When your application has multiple views that the customer can navigate to, creating a wireframe for each of those views, and then showing how the user is directed to each is critical.

Here is another example by one of your predecessors.

Note how each view of her application was clearly defined with low fidelity. Then, for each interactive element, arrows were used to indicate which view would be presented if clicked.

### Learn from Successful Students

Here is a great example from a group project team that was assigned to build a complex application that had many views. This team took the time to clearly understand which views they needed, which content would be displayed on each, the layout of the content, and how interactions would work.

It took them 1.5 days to plan their project. It then took them 3 days to implement it, to completion.

Another team did not spend time to plan and design their project. They produced no wireframes and starting coding after just a few hours of preparation. This team spent 4.5 days trying to implement the project, and were only able to get 50% of it completed.
