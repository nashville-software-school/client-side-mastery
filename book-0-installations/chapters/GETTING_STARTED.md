# Getting Started

## Journal

Get a nice journal and a comfortable pen, and start keeping a daily journal of what you are learning every day. Writing your thoughts on a regular basis [increases your ability to remember it](https://www.lifehack.org/articles/featured/writing-and-remembering-why-we-remember-what-we-write.html). There are even studies that found writing is [beneficial for your health](https://www.apa.org/monitor/sep01/keepdiary.aspx).

## Hardware

Up until now, you didn't have the power to destroy your machine, but within the first two weeks of attending Nashville Software School you will have that power. Go buy a backup drive _**RIGHT NOW**_ and start backing up your entire hard drive.

**Seriously, _right now!_**

## Google Chrome

Google Chrome is the most popular browser for web developers because of the powerful tools it provides to test code, manipulate documents, and measure performance.

Download [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html), and then [make it your default browser](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95417?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en).

## GitHub

> 🧨 If you already created your Github account, skip this step

GitHub is the primary site that software developers throughout the world use to store their code, and share it with other developers. Create your account using a **professional** username. Make it as close to your actual name as you can.

After you make your account you need to make sure your full name is updated in your settings.

1. Click on the profile icon at the top-right of Github.
1. Choose "Settings".
1. Enter your full name in the "Name" field.
1. Scroll down and click "Update Profile".
