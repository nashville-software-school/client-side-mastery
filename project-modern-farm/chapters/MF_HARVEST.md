# Collecting the Harvest

## Setup

Have a terminal window open and change directory to `~/workspace/modern-farm`.

Run `npm run test` to start the automated testing task.

## Harvesting Instructions

1. Create a `scripts/harvester.js` module.
1. In this module, define and export a `harvestPlants` function.
1. The `harvestPlants` function must accept the plants array as input.
1. The function will return an array of seed objects.
1. Iterate the array of growing plants. On each plant, get the value of the `output` property.
1. Add that many of the plant objects to the array that the function returns. For example, if the current plant is a peanut object with an output of 2...
    ```js
    {
        type: "Peanut",
        height: 30,
        output: 2
    }
    ```
    Then the array that the function returns should have two identical objects added to it.
    ```js
    [
        {
            type: "Peanut",
            height: 30,
            output: 2
        },
        {
            type: "Peanut",
            height: 30,
            output: 2
        }
    ]
    ```
1. Again, the exception is corn. Half of your corn will be sold to cattle ranchers, so only half of the output of each corn plant will be added to the array that this function returns.

#### Checking Your Logic

In the `main.js` module, get the array of plants from the field module, and then harvest them by invoking the appropriate function that you defined above. Make sure you specify the array of plants as an argument to the harvesting function.

Then use `console.log()` to see your new array of harvested food to sell.
