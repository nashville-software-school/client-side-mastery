# Challenges for Ch10: Passing more to the AnimalCard Component

## Waiting List

Using what you now know about passing functions in as props, create a waiting list in your animal component.  There should be:
1. A list of animals waiting to be seen
1. A button on each `AnimalCard` that when clicked adds an animal to the list.
1. Bonus: Can you add a button to remove an animal from the wait list?


## Multi-delted (hard)

Add a checkbox to each animal and a "Delete All Selected" button to the AnimalList.js.  When the "Delete All Selected" button is clicked, all animals that are checked should be deleted.  

Note: You will need to account for checking and unchecking of the checkboxes.
