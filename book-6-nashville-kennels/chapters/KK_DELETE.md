# Firing Employees

A problem that many retail businesses deal with is employee theft. Over the years, you have discovered that some of your employees eat candy while on the job without paying for it.

When this happens, you need to fire the employee and remove the employee from the database.

* Add a button labeled "Fire Employee" to each employee representation.
* When the button is clicked, remove the employee from the database and render the updated list of employees.
