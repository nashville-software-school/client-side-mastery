# Display Products at a Store

If you haven't yet, create a **`LocationDetails`** component that displays the details of an individual location for the Kandy Korner franchise. This component should render when the URL is `http://localhost:3000/location/{some id}`.

When the component renders, it should list all of the products that are sold at that location. You can do an unordered list or just separate the products with commas.
