# Kandy Korner Customers

In this chapter, you are going to create a login form where customers can provide their authentication and personal information so that they can make purchases online.

Utilize the same components as you did in Kennels to implement a login screen in Kandy Korner.

* `src/components/auth/Login.js`
* `src/components/auth/Register.js`

Use `kandy_customer` as the local storage item for tracking authentication.

Then refactor **`KandyKorner`** to implement the login screen.
