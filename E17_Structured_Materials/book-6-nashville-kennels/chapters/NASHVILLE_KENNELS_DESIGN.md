## Design

Whether you're building in vanilla JavaScript, React or another framework, defining the models and their relationships in an app is still the first step.  Take a few minutes to design an ERD for Nashville Kennels.  

When you are finished with the ERD, peak at [this](./KENNELS_ERD.md) one.  In tech there is usually more than one way to solve a problem.  If you ERD doesn't match the one given, it doesn't mean it's wrong.  Talk through your ERD with an instructor.  The remainder of this book however will be based off of the ERD provided.
