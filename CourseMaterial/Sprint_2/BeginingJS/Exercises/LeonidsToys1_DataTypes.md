 Leonid Androvsky is a second-generation Lithuanian who took over the hand-made toy shoppe that his father, Antonin, started and managed for 42 years. What was once known as Antonin's Toy World got renamed by Leonid to Leonid's Bespoke Toy Shoppe to attract more modern parents.

> Leonid has hired you to write some code that will help him keep track of his toy inventory. He knows nothing about code or software, so you need to learn the basics so that he can start to automate his business practices.

## Practice: Toy Data Types

Think about what kind of data that Leonid would need to store about his toys. For example, the name of the toy. What data type would that be?

Write down some other properties of toys that he would need to keep track of, and the data type for each. When you're done, talk with your teammates, or talk to a member of your instruction team to review your ideas.
