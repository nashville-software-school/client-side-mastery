## Coffee Houses

> The learning objective for this practice exercise is to use display:flex on a list component, and then add additional CSS properties to achieve a desired layout.

```jsx
<header class="pageHeader">Coffee Houses of Nashville</header>

<section class="list">
  <article class="shop">The Jam</article>
  <article class="shop">The Well</article>
  <article class="shop">Red Bicycle</article>
  <article class="shop">Crema</article>
  <article class="shop">Frothy Monkey</article>
  <article class="shop">8th &amp; Roast</article>
  <article class="shop">Bongo Java</article>
  <article class="shop">Flatrock</article>
  <article class="shop">Fido</article>
  <article class="shop">Steadfast Coffee</article>
  <article class="shop">Dose Coffee</article>
  <article class="shop">Sam &amp; Zoes</article>
  <article class="shop">Slow Hand Coffee</article>
  <article class="shop">The Horn</article>
</section>
```

From that HTML, use Flexbox to achieve this layout. You don't need to add the border to each coffee house component, but you can if you like. It's been added in this example to highlight the alignment and spacing you're shooting for.
