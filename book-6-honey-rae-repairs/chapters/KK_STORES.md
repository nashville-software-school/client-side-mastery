# Kandy Korner Locations

1. Create a couple of objects in your `database.json` file to represent some locations.
1. Create a directory to hold all of your files for locations.
1. Create a module for the location list component.
1. In your location list module, utilize the `useEffect()` React hook to get the array of locations from your API. All of this will be nearly identical to Kennels.
1. Then render all locations in the browser.
