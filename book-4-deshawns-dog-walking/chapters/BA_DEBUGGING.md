# Fixing Brewed Awakenings Receipts

Brewed Awakenings is a local coffee shop that wants a web site that shows which products they are selling, and which employee is selling them. Here's all of the information they want on their web site.

1. A list of employees.
1. A list of products.
1. A list of orders that shows which product was sold, and which employee sold it.

Here's what the output of the application should look like.

## Setup

Run the following command in your terminal.

```sh
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nashville-software-school/client-side-mastery/master/book-4-deshawns-dog-walking/chapters/scripts/brewed-setup.sh)"
```

That script will create the `workspace/brewed-awakenings` directory for you. Just `cd` to that directory and open it in Viual Studio Code.

Then run the `serve` command and open the URL in Chrome.
