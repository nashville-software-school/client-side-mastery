# Normalizing the Bouquet Database

Look at your ERD and your data and see if there are any data that is repeated over and over again. Consider what additional tables could be created in your ERD to normalize the database and save space and reduce the need to perform a massive update of the data.

One hint: Start with your **Flowers** table. Any values in there repeated several times?
