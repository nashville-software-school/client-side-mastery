# Are You Feeling Bouquet? - Flower Shops

Flower shops are retailers for the flower industry. Each one buys their flowers from a single distributor.

### The Bouquet ERD

Use dbdiagram.io to create an ERD that visualizes the **Retailers** resource. Each of these businesses should have a name, city, state, and address. Just dummy data. Don't worry about creating real addresses.

```html
Table Retailers {
}
```

### API Resources

Add this resource to your database and create at least 5 flower shops.

```json
{
    "retailers": []
}
```

### HTML Representations

Create your data provider, your list component and your individual item component. Then display a list of all retailers in your database.
