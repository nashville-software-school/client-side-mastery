## Who Wrote this Code?

In this exercise, you will be implementing a many-to-many relationships just like you did in the last chapter, but in the reverse relationship.

Instead of listing employees and the customer they have worked for, you need to display all customers and the employees that have worked for them.

1. Create a **`CustomerList`** list component.
1. Copy and paste the code from **`EmployeeList`** into it.
1. Refactor it to show employees per customer.
