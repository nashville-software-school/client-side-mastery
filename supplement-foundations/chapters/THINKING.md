# Thinking Like a Software Developer

The most common misconception amongst muggles is that being a successful software developer is about mastering code syntax and software patterns.

It isn't.

Successful software developers are highly proficient at a the follow skills.

1. **Analytical thinking**. This the ability to tackle complicated issues by evaluating information you’ve gathered and organized. Analytical thinkers can detect patterns between systems that can lead to creative solutions.
1. **Algorithmic thinking**. This involves breaking down a large, abstract problem into smaller, achievable tasks, and then ordering those tasks into a logical algorithm to solve problems.
1. **Efficient learning**. Efficient learners are able to objectively and critically identify gaps in their skills and devise a coherent strategy for gaining those skills.
1. **Communication**. To be truly valuable, you have to master complex communication - both to your technical and non-technical teammates. Developers who cannot communicate effectively bring little value to modern teams.

## Your First Algorithm

Since you did the Foundations Course, you know what a variable is, so for this problem, you need to focus on devising an algorithm for solving it. You do not need to be thinking about any other feature of JavaScript other than variables.

Ready?

Here are two variables.

```js
let myApples = 5
let yourApples = 11
```

You need to switch the value of each variable. You can't define any other variables as part of the algorithm. When your algorithm runs, the value of `myApples` should be 11, and the value of `yourApples` should be 5.
