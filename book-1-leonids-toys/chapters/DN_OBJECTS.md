# Adding More Notes

In the last chapter, you had an algorithm that defined the code you needed to write before you wrote any code.

That's smart.

Keep doing that.

## Instructions

For this chapter, you need to add at least 3 more notes to your array, but this time you must use the `.push()` array method on the array to add them, even if you did it in the last chapter. Chances are that you have already forgotten the syntax, or at least feel unsure about.

That's normal and part of the life of a professional - especially a beginner.

How a professional handles this situation?

1. Refer to old code where the syntax had been used previously.
1. Search the Web if the code has never been written before, or its location can't be recalled.

> A professional **never** thinks, "I should remember how to do this. I'll just stare at my screen and slap different code in here until it works."

## Hint

Remember, use all the other resources at your disposal before looking at hints. Start thinking like a professional now and become an efficient learner, not a lazy one.
