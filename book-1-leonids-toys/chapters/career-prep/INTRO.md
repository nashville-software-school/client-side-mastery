# What to Expect from NewForce Career Prep

At NewForce, we care a lot about three main things:

1. Preparing you to be a junior developer-- both in terms of technical skills and soft skills
2. Preparing you for your first job search as a junior developer
3. Connecting you with employers who are hiring junior developers!

By the time you graduate and get to step three, you'll not only be prepared to crush your first day on the job-- you'll also be ready to crush all of the applications and interviews leading up to that first day. Our job is not only to train you; it's also to help you represent that training on a resume and talk about your experience to employers. Getting in the door at your first tech job is undeniably hard. (Heck, any career change is hard! That's not just tech.) We're here to make the whole process less confusing and scary, starting with your very first day. 

## Here's what the process will look like:

### First Half of the Program
During the first half of the program, you'll learn: 
1. How to represent your prior experience on a resume and relate it to your journey into tech
1. How to write a cover letter
1. How to talk about your experience-- both at NewForce and in your previous jobs-- in interviews
1. How to prepare for technical interviews
1. How to put together killer LinkedIn and GitHub profiles (you'll also get professional headshots taken)

### Second Half of the Program
During the second half of the program, you'll go through every phase of a realistic mock application process. You'll practice:
1. Tailoring your resume
1. Customizing a cover letter
1. Communicating with a fake recruiter who definitely isn't Jordan
1. Going through multiple rounds of interviews
1. Negotiating a practice job offer

### After you graduate
For most of you, the job search probably feels like the least of your worries. After all, you have to learn to code first! That's totally fine. Rest assured that we're thinking about your job search starting on day one of the program even if you don't have the bandwidth to think about it yet. We'll start bringing employers in to speak to the class in the second half of the program. We'll start connecting you to open jobs around six weeks before you graduate. We'll coach you through the whole process, even after you're no longer in class. We don't just go away at the end of the six months! We can't guarentee placement (or a particularly speedy job search-- sometimes it just takes a while!) but we will do everything we can to get you connected to companies that match your interests.
