# Free Giffygram CSS

Before you start with JavaScript coding, here's some free CSS to make your application look good.

Run the following command in the terminal. It does not matter which directory you are currently in when you run it.

```sh
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nashville-software-school/client-side-mastery/cohort-48/book-3-giffygram/chapters/scripts/giffygram-styles.sh)"
```

The script creates the `giffygram/src/styles` directory and creates the following files in it.

1. `main.css`
1. `post.css`
1. `feed.css`
1. `navigation.css`
1. `footer.css`

You can double check that they were created by viewing the contents of that directory. If they did not get created, please visit an instructor ASAP to get it working correctly.
