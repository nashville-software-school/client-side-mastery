# Giffygram: Social Animation Platform

Perhaps you've used other social media platforms that allow users to share beautiful pictures with each other. An opportunity that you've discovered is that none of these platforms specialize in Gif animation images. You went to some angel investors and convinced them that you have a solid business plan and that people around the world have been craving an app for sharing only gifs.

## Minimally Viable Product (MVP)

MVP is an acronym that you are going to hear many times here at NSS and when you are working as a professional. Very briefly, an MVP is the absolute minimal amount of features that are needed for an application so that it can be put in the hands on users to get feedback.

Here are some example MVP features.

* Authentication
* Creating a resource
* Viewing the resources
* Organizing resources

If you build those, you can have people use it. They can start providing you feedback and additional feature requests while you are building the features that you want to add, but weren't needed for MVP.

You will be guided through how to create all of the components for this application, how to think about how they work together to make a good user experience, and how to manage the state of the entire application, and of individual components.

Here's the MVP that you will be building for Giffygram.
