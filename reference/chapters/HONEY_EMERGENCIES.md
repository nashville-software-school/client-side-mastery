# Show Emergency Tickets

In this chapter, you will be creating, and observing, more state variables with `useState()` and `useEffect()` to allow employees toggle between seeing a filtered list of tickets that are emergencies, or all tickets.

## Emergency Button Implementation

This section shows you how to use a button to allow a user to update a state variable. You will then implement another `useEffect()` hook to observe that state change to display on service tickets that are marked as an emergency.

Watch the [Show Only Emergency Tickets](https://watch.screencastify.com/v/NYREp42EGNkq8knMeZAY) video and then implement the code yourself.

## Only Employees Can Filter Emergencies

This section shows you how to use use ternary statements to conditionally show React components depending on the state of the component.

Watch the [Emergency Button Only For Employees](https://watch.screencastify.com/v/2Z8UeVBNWGTdxja23Un1) video and then implement the code yourself.

## Allow Employee to Switch Back

This section shows you how to add another button to allow an employee to show **all** tickets again after the list has been filtered down to emergency tickets.
