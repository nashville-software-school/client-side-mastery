# Adding a New Note

In this chapter you will practice using the `push()` method that is available on every array to add things a new notes to your array.

After your initial array definition, create a new note about today. Give it the same properties as the other two notes.

Don't forget the `id` property.

```js
const noteAboutToday = {

}
```

Now that you have a new note object, add that new object to the end of your `notes` array with the `push()` method. Make sure you write this code before the `console.log()` so that all of your notes will be displayed in the terminal.
