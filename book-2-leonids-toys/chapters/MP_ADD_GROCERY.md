# Now That I Think About It...

After you wrote the initial, high-priority list of items you need to buy at the supermarket, you realize that there are lower-priority ones, and then there downright "wants".

You realize that the list might get very long, and you don't want to keep track of the primary key for each object that gets added to your shopping list.


Write a function named `addToShoppingList` that will add a new grocery item to your array. The function should add an `id` property to the grocery object that you provide as an argument when the function is invoked.

Also add a `dateCreated` property to the object whose value will be the current date and time.

Use your function to add 5 new items to your shopping list with a variety of prices ranging from $4 to $16.
