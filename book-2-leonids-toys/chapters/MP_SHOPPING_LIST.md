# Grocery Run

You open your refrigerator on Saturday morning and are immediately forlorn when you stare at the largely empty shelves. You need to make a run to the supermarket.

## Setup

```sh
cd ~/workspace
mkdir shopping-list
cd shopping-list
touch shopping.js

code .
```

## High Priority Items

Open `shopping.js` and declare a variable whose value will be an array filled with objects. Each object will represent an item that you first think of when you go to the store.

Common items are:

1. Milk
1. Eggs
1. Pizza rolls
1. A protein
1. Your favorite fruit
1. Sandwich buns
1. Condiments

You can create as many objects as you like. Make sure each one has a primary key and a **`price`** property. The rest of the properties are completely up to you.

When you've added the objects to your array and use `console.log()` to output the array to the terminal. Run your code and make sure so errors are displayed.
