# Finding a Note

In this chapter, you need to define a variable named `searchTerm`. It's value can be the value of any property value you like from your notes. For example, if one of your notes has a `feeling` property whose value is `"Compunctious"`, you're variable declaration would be the code below.

```js
const searchTerm = "Compunctious"
```

Use that search term in your `for..of` loop to output only the object that has the value for the corresponding property.

Here is boilerplate code. You need to enter in the proper condition for the `if` code block. Refer back to the code you wrote for Leonid's toys since you won't remember this code yet.

It take a long time to do it from memory.

```js
for (const note of notes) {
    if () {

    }
}
```
