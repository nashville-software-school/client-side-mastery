# Twhoops: Tracking Tweets that Politicians Don't Want you to See

You are going to be building an application that uses the [Politwoops API](https://politwoops.eu/page/api). This API exposes every Tweet that gets deleted by a politician or ambassador from around the world.

The learning goals of this project are the following.

* Using `fetch` to retrieve external data
* Event listeners
* Collecting user input and acting on it
* Modular CSS
* Modular JavaScript
* Identifying and building components

Here are the features you will be building over the next few months in this application.

* Allow user to search for specific people.
* List people that the user searched for.
* Allow user to favorite specific people.
* List the deleted tweets of any selected person.
* Allow user to favorite specific, deleted tweets.
* Allow user to search for specific words in all tweets by all people.

Give those feature requests, you need to do the following tasks.

1. Identify the components that need to be rendered in this applications.
1. Identify the structure and relationship of the components _(e.g. a Tweet component is rendered as a child of the TweetList component)_
1. Decide on a layout for your Twhoops application. Draw a simple wireframe that shows where each component will be rendered.
1. Come see a member of the instruction team to review your component layout.
1. One you and one of your instructors discuss your layout, then you can create a new project directory of `~/workspace/twhoops`, and start building the HTML and CSS of your components and layout.
