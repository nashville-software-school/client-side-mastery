## Practice: Coffee Houses of Nashville

> The learning objective for this practice exercise is to use `display:flex` on two elements, and then add additional CSS properties to achieve a desired layout.

```html
<header class="pageHeader">Coffee Houses of Nashville</header>

<article class="list">
  <section class="shop">The Jam</section>
  <section class="shop">The Well</section>
  <section class="shop">Red Bicycle</section>
  <section class="shop">Crema</section>
  <section class="shop">Frothy Monkey</section>
  <section class="shop">8th &amp; Roast</section>
  <section class="shop">Bongo Java</section>
  <section class="shop">Flatrock</section>
  <section class="shop">Fido</section>
  <section class="shop">Steadfast Coffee</section>
  <section class="shop">Dose Coffee</section>
  <section class="shop">Sam &amp; Zoes</section>
  <section class="shop">Slow Hand Coffee</section>
  <section class="shop">The Horn</section>
</article>
```

From that HTML, use Flexbox to achieve this layout. You don't need to add the border. It's been added in this example to highlight the alignment and spacing you're shooting for.
