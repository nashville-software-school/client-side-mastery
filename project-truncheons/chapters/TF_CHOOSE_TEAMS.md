# Choosing Teams

When the user clicks the button to start a new game, display three dropdowns. Each dropdown displays all teams. When the user selects a team, update the state of the game. That state must be a collection of teams.

You can use an object or an array to store the teams that are chosen by the user.

As soon as all three teams are chosen, immediate display a form where the user can enter in each team's score for round 1.
