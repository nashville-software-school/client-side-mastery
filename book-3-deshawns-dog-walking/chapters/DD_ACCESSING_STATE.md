# Reading Hidden State

Now that you have some hidden, developer-only, state in your HTML, you can extract that state when the user _does something_. In this project, the _something_ you will be reacting to is the user clicking on a list item.

## Event Listeners

When the user does _something_, you can react to it with an event listener. Common events that a developer's code reacts to are.

1. User types something into an input field
1. User clicks on some HTML element
1. User scrolls to a certain point in the document
1. User places the mouse over a particular element

There are many more possible events, but those are some of the most common ones we listen to and write code to do something when that event happens.

## Accessing State for Interactivity

Again, refer to the [Using data attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Howto/Use_data_attributes) article to see how the `dataset` property on an HTML element is available to JavaScript for accessing state.

Watch the following video to see how to access state when the user clicks on an HTML element, and then use state to present a message.
