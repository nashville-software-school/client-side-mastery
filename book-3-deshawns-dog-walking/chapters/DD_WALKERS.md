# Who's Walking Whom

Using the event listener code provided as an example, see if you can update the **`RegisteredPets`** module to capture when a user clicks on a pet. When the user does click a pet, display an alert that says who is currently walking it.

| <h1>&#x1F4A1;</h1> |  _Make sure you import the walkers state into the module._ |
| <h1>&#x1F4A1;</h1> |  _You will need _another_ `for..of` loop inside a `for..of` loop. It's called a nested loop._ |
| <h1>&#x1F4A1;</h1> |  _You can avoid the nested `for..of` loop by using the `.find()` [array method](https://javascript.info/array-methods#find-and-findindex)._ |

## Dev Tools Practice

Use the Event Listeners panel to discover, and the Event Listener Breakpoints panel to debug, the events in your code. If you don't know what this means, then you skipped chapter 5 of the guided tour.

Go read that chapter now and watch the accompanying video.
