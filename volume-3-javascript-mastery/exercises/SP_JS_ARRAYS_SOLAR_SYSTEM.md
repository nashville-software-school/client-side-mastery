# Solar System

## Setup

These commands are a helpful quick start. You may choose to ignore them completely and create your own directory structure. If you choose to use this recommendation, just copy the commands below and paste. It doesn't matter what directory you are currently in.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/workspace/exercises/spa/array-methods && cd $_
touch index.html
touch array-methods.js
```

## Requirements

1. Copy the code below into the JavaScript file, and follow the instructions in the comments.

```javascript
var planets = ["mercury", "venus", "earth", "mars", "jupiter", "saturn", "uranus", "neptune"];

/*
 Use the forEach method to add the name of each planet
 to a div element in your HTML with an id of "planets".
*/
var el = document.getElementById("planets");

// Use the map method to create a new array where the first letter of each planet is capitalized

// Use the filter method to create a new array that contains planets with the letter 'e'

// Use the reduce method to create a sentence from the words in the following array

var words = ["The", "early", "bird", "might", "get", "the", "worm", "but", "the", "second", "mouse", "gets", "the", "cheese"];
```
