# Work Experience 

When describing your previous work experience before NewForce, keep the following tips in mind:

- Always format your work experience using bullet points. Recruiters go through tons of resumes daily, so bullet points allow them to skim efficiently. 

- Make your descriptions detailed. Help employers understand the tasks and you completed in your experience, not just the themes. For example, instead of having “customer service” as a bullet point description, include something like, “provided attentive customer service by listening and assisting each customer with their needs until they were satisfied with their service”

- Tying in with the above point, always lead your bullet points with action verbs. Here’s a [great resource!](https://www.themuse.com/advice/185-powerful-verbs-that-will-make-your-resume-awesome)

- Highlight the aspects that are relevant to development. For example, implementations, systems used, analysis experience, collaborating with a team, process improvements, meeting deadlines, problem solving, teamwork, etc.
