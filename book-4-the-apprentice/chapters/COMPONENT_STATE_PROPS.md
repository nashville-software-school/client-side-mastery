# React Component State and Props

## State

State is simply the current values of the properties used to render a component. Your brain will try to make it more complex than that, so remember this statement.

> State is simply the current values of the properties used to render a component.

You initialize state by defining a `state` object in your component constructor. Let's take a look at how to implement state for our **`Kennel`** component.

```js
import React, { Component } from "react";
import EmployeeList from "./EmployeeList";
import LocationList from "./LocationList";

export default class Kennel extends Component {
  state = {
    employees: [
      { name: "Jessica Younker" },
      { name: "Jordan Nelson" },
      { name: "Zoe LeBlanc" },
      { name: "Blaise Roberts" }
    ],
    locations: [{ name: "Nashville North" }, { name: "Nashville South" }]
  };

  render() {
    return (
      <React.Fragment>
        <LocationList locations={this.state.locations} />
        <EmployeeList employees={this.state.employees} />
      </React.Fragment>
    );
  }
}
```

Each of those attributes for the child components become keys on a `props` object.

> EmployeeList.js

```js
import React, { Component } from 'react'


export default class EmployeeList extends Component {
    render() {
        return ({
            /*
            This is a reference to the employees array
            defined in the state object in Kennel.js
            */
            this.props.employees
        })
    }
}
```

Now you can use the `map()` array method to convert the raw data into HTML elements.

```js
import React, { Component } from "react";

export default class EmployeeList extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <React.Fragment>
        {this.props.employees.map(employee => <div>{employee.name}</div>)}
      </React.Fragment>
    );
  }
}
```

## Practice Exercise - Displaying Locations

Update your application so that the array of locations is passed from the **`Kennel`** state to the props of **`LocationList`**. Then use the `map()` method to display all location names.

## Practice Exercise - Displaying Animals

Now that you are passing state from the **`Kennel`** to the **`EmployeeList`** and **`LocationList`**, you're going to list animals now.

1.  Create a new state array in the **`Kennel`** component named `animals`.
2.  Create a **`AnimalList`** component for displaying animals.
3.  Update **`Kennel`** to pass its `animals` state to **`AnimalList`** and use the appropriate key on `this.props` to display all animal names.

## Advanced Exercise

1.  Add an `id` property to each of your existing resources.
1.  Add the following `owners` property to the **`Kennel`** state.
    ```js
    state = {
      employees: [
        { id: 1, name: "Jessica Younker" },
        { id: 2, name: "Jordan Nelson" },
        { id: 3, name: "Zoe LeBlanc" },
        { id: 4, name: "Blaise Roberts" }
      ],
      locations: [
        { id: 1, name: "Nashville North" },
        { id: 2, name: "Nashville South" }
      ],
      animals: [
        { id: 1, name: "Doodles" },
        { id: 2, name: "Jack" },
        { id: 3, name: "Angus" },
        { id: 4, name: "Henley" },
        { id: 5, name: "Derkins" },
        { id: 6, name: "Checkers" }
      ],
      owners: [
        { id: 1, name: "Ryan Tanay" },
        { id: 2, name: "Emma Beaton" },
        { id: 3, name: "Dani Adkins" },
        { id: 4, name: "Adam Oswalt" },
        { id: 5, name: "Fletcher Bangs" },
        { id: 6, name: "Angela Lee" }
      ]
    };
    ```
1.  You create the intersection table and assign each animal to an owner.

Your task is to update the **`AnimalList`** component to also display the name of the animal's owner. You'll need to pass multiple collections - not just `animals` - to the component in order to accomplish this.
