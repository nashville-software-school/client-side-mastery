## ERD

Before you create any actual state data structures in your code, create an ERD for this application. Consider not only the resources above, but also how the customer's order will be stored and the properties on those objects.

Once you have an ERD created, but are unsure if you got it right, feel free to run it by your peers or an instructor.

## Database

Once your ERD is complete, then go to the `database` module and start setting up your data structures for each resource. Also set up the `get*()` and `set*()` function you think you need.

You might forget some of them now, and that's fine. You'll discover what you missed when you start to build out the functionality.
