# Display Your Options

1. Create a module that is responsible for displaying the overall HTML structure for your app. It will be the equivalent of the **`KneelDiamonds`** module.
1. Create four modules in your `scripts` directory, each being responsible for display the four different option groups, just like you did in Kneel Diamonds.
1. Import those four modules into the module you created in step one and interpolate them in the appropriate places in the overall HTML structure.
1. Make sure you have a heading for each group of options.
