# Wait, It Doesn't Work

When you start your web server for the new project and load it in the browser, you will immediately notice that there are syntax errors.

Time to practice your debugging skills again!!

This time, it's more complex. Instead of a misspelled variable, or a missing `+` operator, this time, there are functions missing that you need to write. Don't worry, though, you won't have to write functions that are more complex than what you've already seen quite a few times already.

Once you have updated that code so that no more errors are happening, move on to the next chapter.

Remember to use all of the resources at your disposal. the Web, your peers and your instructors.

This is a good time to remind you that this isn't school. We don't want you to do this by yourself. Professional software developers use **every** possible resource to get things working and do their best to learn what they can as they do it.

If you really, really, want to, you can [watch how to fix the initial errors](https://vimeo.com/519286816).
