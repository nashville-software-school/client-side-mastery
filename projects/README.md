# Course Projects

After you complete the work in the Core Books of the course, you instructors will provide guidance on which of these projects that you can choose to work on. There are four tiers of projects.

## Tier 1 - Beginner

Tier 1 projects are for students to start working on in the first couple weeks of the course. These projects may start simple to reinforce the basics of what has been covered, but will also scale with you as you progress in skills.

1. [Daily Journal](./tier-1/daily-journal/) - This project will scale with your skills. You begin with basic wireframes and data design, and by the end of the project, you will have built a highly complex, modular web application.
2. [Modern Farm](./tier-1/modern-farm/) - This project will focus almost exclusively on deepening your JavaScript fundamental skills. The project also has automated testing implemented so that you can see how tests provide feedback about your progress.

## Tier 2 - Advanced Beginner

Tier 2 projects are for students who have the basic vocabulary and skills in JavaScript and web development, and want to explore the concepts at a deeper level.

1. [Dothard &amp; Simbleton](./tier-2/dothard-simbleton/) - This project will introduce you to the basics of using array methods to iterate arrays in order to find specific things, filter the array, or change each item in the array to another format.
1. [State Fair](./tier-2/state-fair/) - This project will have you exploring the basics of using custom events in a web application to allow for greater control over when the UI is updated when state changes.

## Tier 3 - Apprentice

Tier 3 projects combine all of the skills that you learn in the client-side course to build moderately complex web applications.

1. [Honest Abe](./tier-2/honest-abe/) - This project contains three small applications that you will build using complex data relationships. You will gain a much deeper understanding of how the `find()`, `filter()`, and `map()` array methods work to manipulate data for display to your customers.
1. [Glassdale Cyber Crime Unit](./tier-3/glassdale/) - This project focuses on exploring custom events much further than you have used them in the Core Books. You take on the role of a new cyber detective to solve a recent extortion spree in Glassdale, IL.

## Tier 4 - Professional Readiness

Tier 4 projects must be worked on as a team. They are broad in scope, require coordination of effort, and have a large number of complex features. When 2 or more students have reached the level of proficiency to accomplish a project of this scale, the instruction team will coordinate the effort of starting one.

1. [Truncheons & Flagons](./tier-3/truncheons/) - This project involves implementing an ancient tavern game so that modern enthusiasts can enjoy a blast from the past.
1. [Giffygram](./tier-4/giffygram/) - This project has your entire team examining an already deployed application, and then testing your ability to deconstuct it. Deconstruction is an advanced skill that challenges your ability to think critically, and creatively when examining someone else's code.
