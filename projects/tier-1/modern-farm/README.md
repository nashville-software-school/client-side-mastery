# Modern Farm

This project has very specific requirements for how you should structure and organize your code. Attention to details is very important **before** you write your code. We strongly recommend that after reading the requirements, that your team generate a **Dependency Graph** and **Sequence Diagram**. You may not get it right at first, so make sure you update it as you build the project.
