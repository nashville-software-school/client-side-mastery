# Fish Fusion Group Project

In this project, you are going to build a purchasing pipeline for a bargain fish restaurant in your city.

There are 3 different actors in this system, and you will write functions in multiple modules of code to have them share data, and in the end, the restaurant will make its final purchases.

1. **Fishing Boat** - This is the source of the fish. The boat catches the fish and makes the fresh catch available to purchasers.
1. **Fishmonger** - The fishmonger purchases fresh fish off the boat, and head chefs around the city visit every morning to get fish for their daily menus.
1. **Fish Restaurant** - The chef at fish restaurant purchases fresh fish from the fishmonger every day. To keep her prices low, she purchases lower cost food and combines them in tasty ways that people might not expect.

## Before You Start

It is **crucial** that your team reads all of the requirements and builds an algorithm with comments before you write a single line of code. It is highly recommended that you build the algorithm completely and review it with one of your mentors before starting on implementation.
