# Fish Fusion Project Setup

Run the following command in your terminal to create the directory structure and files for the project.

```sh
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NSS-Day-Cohort-69/client-side-mastery/master/projects/tier-1/fish-fusion/scripts/setup.sh)"
```

Once that completes, run the following two commands to navigate to the directory that was created and then install some open source software that will be needed.

```sh
cd ~/workspace/fish-fusion
npm install
```

Once the installation is complete, open up the project in Visual Studio Code.

```sh
code .
```

When the project opens, you can all move on to the next chapter and start reading the requirements for the project.
