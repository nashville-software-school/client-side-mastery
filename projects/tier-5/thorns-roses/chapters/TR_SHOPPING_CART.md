# Shopping Cart View

Time to provide a shopping cart view for wedding planners as they purchase flowers.

## Cart View

1. Create a new link in your **`NavBar`** component labeled "My Cart".
1. When the user clicks on the "My Cart" item in the navigation bar, a view showing a summary of flowers to be purchased should be displayed.
1. Each individual flower needs to be a row. It should show the flower species and color, how many of the that flower are going to be purchased, and the total cost.

|Flower|Quantity|Cost|
|--|--|--|
| Red Rose | 18 | $22.45 |
| Purple Hydrangea | 24 | $31.56 |
| White Baby's Breath | 50 | $18.09 |
| Peach Tulip | 18 | $25.51 |

## Cart NavBar Link

When the wedding planner starts clicking the purchase button in the retailer view, see if you can get the total number of flowers displayed next to the link.

Given the shopping cart above, the link would display the following text.

[My Cart (110)]()
